# Alertness-Detection-using-Yolov5

- Built using YoloV5, pytorch and OpenCV.
- Used coco classes to pre-train model to detect objects vs humans.
- Detects "alertness" based on images collected and labeled through labelimg 
- Made to track user's drowsiness during driving to minimize drowsy driving. 
- Further changes to be made in future: 
  - run on a raspberry pi attached with a pieze buzzer/speaker system to wake driver up.
