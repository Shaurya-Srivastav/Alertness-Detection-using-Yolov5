# Alertness-Detection-using-Yolov5

- Built using YoloV5, pytorch and OpenCV.
- Used COCO dataset to pre-train model from YoloV5 to detect objects vs humans.
- Detects "alertness" based on images collected and labeled through labelimg 
- Made to track user's drowsiness during driving to minimize drowsy driving. 
- Further changes to be made in future: 
  - run on a raspberry pi attached with a pieze buzzer/speaker system to wake driver up. 

**Training data can be found in "data" folder**
- trained for 500 epochs using 38 images
